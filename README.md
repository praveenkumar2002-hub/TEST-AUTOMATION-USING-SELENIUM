*DESCRIPTION* :

  Test automation is a crucial part of the software development lifecycle, enabling teams to validate the functionality, performance, and reliability of applications more efficiently than manual testing. Among the many tools and frameworks available, Selenium and TestNG have emerged as a powerful combination for automating web application testing, especially in Java-based test environments.

SELENIUM :
	Selenium is an open-source automation tool primarily used for automating web applications. It allows testers and developers to write test scripts in various programming languages such as Java, Python, C#, Ruby, and JavaScript. Selenium is not a single tool but a suite consisting of four components:

Selenium IDE – A record-and-playback tool for creating simple test scripts without programming.

Selenium WebDriver – The core component that enables interaction with web browsers via code.

Selenium Grid – Used for running tests on multiple machines and browsers in parallel.

Selenium RC – An older version that is now mostly deprecated.

Among these, Selenium WebDriver is the most widely used component in professional test automation setups.

TESTNG :
	TestNG (Test Next Generation) is a testing framework inspired by JUnit and NUnit but designed to offer more powerful and flexible test configurations. It is tailored for the needs of modern test automation. TestNG provides several features that enhance testing efficiency and organization:

Support for annotations such as @Test, @BeforeClass, @AfterMethod, etc.

Ability to group and prioritize test methods.

Parameterization of test data.

Parallel and multi-threaded test execution.

Generation of HTML and XML reports.

Easy integration with build tools like Maven and Ant.

Seamless integration with CI/CD tools like Jenkins.
